# CloudMLOps
Designed, implemented, and deployed a robust environment for machine learning application development, ensuring scalability, collaboration, and adherence to best practices, with deployment on AWS and Azure for production readiness.
Key Responsibilities:

Version Control & Collaboration: Set up a GitHub repository to streamline code collaboration and version control in a team environment.
Environment Management: Configured Python virtual environments using conda to isolate dependencies and ensure compatibility.
Package Management: Developed setup.py and requirements.txt for automated dependency installation and project packaging.

Cloud Deployment:
Deployed the application on AWS EC2 instances, leveraging S3 for storage and RDS for database management.
Implemented Azure deployment using Azure App Services and configured Blob Storage for data handling.
Infrastructure as Code: Used tools like Terraform and CloudFormation to provision and manage cloud resources.
Automation: Automated the deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions and integrated logging and monitoring using AWS CloudWatch and Azure Monitor.
Security: Configured IAM roles and Azure RBAC for secure access control and ensured compliance with security standards.

Tools & Technologies:
Git, GitHub, Python, AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, CloudWatch), Azure (App Services, Blob Storage, RBAC, Monitor), Terraform, CloudFormation, Pip, PyPI, Anaconda/Conda, and VSCode.
